# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a senior at the University of Southern California. Fun fact: At the age of 1, I turned on, played with, and successfully cut vital wires of my dad's ancient computer. At 5 years old, at my mother's company, I walked around, curious, and cut off all the electricity in the building. 

What does that mean? No need to show me how to do things. I hunt for areas of improvement and dive right in. 
**_No Asking Around_**, **_No Time Wasted_**. **_Always Conscientious_**. **_Always Exceeding Expectations_**.  

Most importantly, **never stop making positive impact to society. Be as curious as ever.**
