- Implemented back-propagation using a Rectified Linear Unit activation function (ReLU) and calculating gradients of the objective function to iteratively update ANN weights. 
- Used Python ML package **sklearn** to train a neural network to predict the “Concrete Compressive Strength” of a dataset.
