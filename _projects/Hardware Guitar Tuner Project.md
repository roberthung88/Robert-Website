description: Built a tuner that detects whether or not a note is on-pitch

- Analyzed electrical circuits, calculated desired voltages, resistances, capacitances to build desirable circuit models/filters
- Assembled the components (using PSpice, oscilloscope, meters... etc)
- Built a tuner that detects whether or not a note is on-pitch, using resistors, capacitors, IC chips... etc.
- If the note's frequency matches the resonance frequency of the circuit, a light bulb will light up, showing that it is on-pitch.
