- Created a Web-Search Engine: simulation of web-crawler that crawls files on PC, implementation of PageRank, web (file) parser, creation of separate UI, search engine, webpage classes, ability to search for AND, OR, DIFF queries. 
- Created an own version of Git to allow for conventional GitHub operations on simple text files. 
- Created a Heap implementation and application. Implemented BST/AVL Tree Iterators
- Created a game of “Reversi” (Othello) and paid special attention to memory management, copy semantics, class structures.
- Wrote a program to 4-color a map using recursion and backtracking. Analyzed program runtime to allow for optimal execution.
