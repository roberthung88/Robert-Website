- Used **OpenCV** and trained the **MobileNet-SSD** detection network to detect vehicles. Measured their distances using binocular camera--preprocessed images using **Rectification, Stereo-matched** images from both cameras, and used **Stereo Vision** method (trigonometry, focal lengthâ€¦ etc.). Velocity is determined by dividing distance by 1/FPS. Distance and Time of Arrival are then processed to determine if it is safe for a vehicle to turn left.
