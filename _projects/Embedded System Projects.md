- Built circuits of various functions using the Arduino Uno microcontroller and oscilloscopes.
- Some projects include a system that uses buttons to produce morse code, a simple number lock that utilizes buttons and an LCD display, a system that utilizes rotary encoders as analog inputs to produce various pitches and a digital stopwatch. 
- The biggest project uses an ultrasonic rangefinder to measure distance and relay the information to a remote device.
